# Adaptive_MATLAB
This repo contains my design and simulations of 2 link rigid robot manipulator controller designs using Adaptive, RISE, CL, ICL, RLC, NN controllers 

## **AIM**: This project aims to design controllers for a 2-link robot manipulator

There are 6 simulations done with 6 controllers, dynamics of the robot are added in a separate folder

* *Simulation 1*: Traditional and Composite Adaptive controller
* *Simulation 2*: Composite adaptive controller with RISE component
* *Simulation 3*: adaptive controller with CL and ICL update law
* *Simulation 4*: RISE based modular adaptive controller
* *Simulation 5*: Repetitive learning controller
* *Simulation 6*: Neural Network-based controller with a discontinuous sliding-mode feedback control law for the dynamics
              Neural Network-based controller with a continuous RISE feed-back control law for the dynamics

Each zip file has controller designs as .m files and report to discuss the simulation results
